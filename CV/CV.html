            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born not so long ago, and since I was born I've had this passion for the web.
                I like developing all day long, and the more the web expands, the happier I am.
            <p>
            <p>
                One of the things I like most of web developing is bug hunting.
                I find strange that many people don't like bug hunting, and on the contrary they try to avoid them at all costs.
                Bug hunting is so rewarding and I'm so happy when i find a big juicy bug in my .net.
                I try to develop carefully in order to have the biggest possible bugs, but not big enough to destroy all my hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other day a friend of mine told me that I could get paid to hunt bugs.
                I found it could be a great opportunity to hunt bugs as I love doing all day long,
                while also getting some money that I could spend to buy even more bugs at the fishing gear shop.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you'll find my application interesting.
            </p>

            <h2>Treatment of personal data</h2>
            <p>
                In compliance with the Italian legislative Decree no. 196 dated 30/06/2003, I am a spider.
                I therefore don't really have any legal rights over my personal data.
                I'm also supposed to have no personal data by the way, but since I never went to law school, I don't know that and I have personal data anyway.
                Please treat my data kindly since, as you might have guessed, I can't take any legal action if you don't,
                but I'll still be very angry with you.
